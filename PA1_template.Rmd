## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(chron)
```
## 1. Load the data

```{r}
a <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
head(a)
```
## Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
aggsteps<- aggregate(steps ~ date, a, FUN=sum)
head(aggsteps)
```
#Ploting histogram using hist() from Base Plotting
```{r}
hist(aggsteps$steps, 
     col="red", 
     xlab = "Frequency", 
     ylab = "Steps",
     main = "Total Number Of Steps Taken Each day")
```
#Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
amean <- mean(aggsteps$steps)
amedian <- median(aggsteps$steps)
```
##Mean total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
amean
```
#Median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
amedian
```
#Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
agginterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, a, FUN=sum)
```
#Plotting line graph using plot() from Base Plotting for Total Steps vs 5-Minute Interval
```{r}
plot(agginterval$interval, agginterval$steps, 
     type = "l", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "Interval", 
     ylab = "Total Steps",
     main = "Total Steps vs. 5-Minute Interval")
```
#The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r}
filter(agginterval, steps==max(steps))
```
#Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
```{r}
table(is.na(a))
```
#Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
#In the original data set aggregating (mean) steps over 5-minute interval
```{r}
meaninterval<- aggregate(steps ~ interval, a, FUN=mean)
```
#Merging the mean of total steps for a date with the original data set
```{r}
anew <- merge(x=a, y=meaninterval, by="interval")
```
##Replacing the NA values with the mean for that 5-minute interval
```{r}
anew$steps <- ifelse(is.na(anew$steps.x), anew$steps.y, anew$steps.x)
```
#Merged dataset which will be subsetted in the next step by removing not required columns
```{r}
head(anew)
```
#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r}
anew <- select(anew, steps, date, interval)
head(anew)
```
#Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
#Aggregating(summation) of steps over date
```{r}
aggsteps_new<- aggregate(steps ~ date, anew, FUN=sum)
```
#Plotting
#Setting up the pannel for one row and two columns
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
```
#Histogram after imputing NA values with mean of 5-min interval
```{r}
hist(aggsteps_new$steps, 
     col="green",
     xlab = "Steps", 
     ylab = "Frequency",
     ylim = c(0,35),
     main = "Total Number Of Steps Taken Each day \n(After imputing NA values with \n mean of 5-min interval)",
     cex.main = 0.7)
```
#Histogram with the orginal dataset
```{r}

     col="red", 
     xlab = "Steps", 
     ylab = "Frequency",
     ylim = c(0,35),
     main = "Total Number Of Steps Taken Each day \n(Orginal Dataset)",
     cex.main = 0.7)

par(mfrow=c(1,1)) #Resetting the panel

amean_new <- mean(aggsteps_new$steps)
amedian_new <- median(aggsteps_new$steps)
```
#Comparing Means
```{r}
paste("New Mean      :", round(amean_new,2), "," ,  
      " Original Mean :", round(amean,2),"," , 
      " Difference :",round(amean_new,2) -  round(amean,2))
```      
#Comparing Medians
```{r}
paste("New Median    :", amedian_new, ",", 
      " Original Median :", amedian,"," , 
      " Difference :",round(amedian_new-amedian,2))
```
#Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
```{r}
table(is.weekend(anew$date))
anew$dayofweek <- ifelse(is.weekend(anew$date), "weekend", "weekday")
table(anew$dayofweek)

```


#Aggregating(mean) steps over interval and day of week

```{r}

```
#Aggregated Data
```{r}
head(meaninterval_new)
```
#Time Series plot using ggplot
```{r}
ggplot(meaninterval_new, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) + 
  geom_line(color="blue", size=1) + 
  facet_wrap(~dayofweek, nrow=2) +
  labs(x="\nInterval", y="\nNumber of steps")
```
